# Question 1

> Suppose I draw a small sample (n < 30) from a population with unknown parameters and use that sample to construct a confidence interval for my estimate of the population mean. In that case my interval will be a function of:

○ The sample mean

○ The sample standard deviation

○ The sample size

○ The t-score corresponding to the confidence level

○ ✅ All of the above


## `Explanation:`

When constructing a confidence interval for the population mean using a small sample (n < 30) from a population with unknown parameters, the interval depends on:

The sample mean – The center of the confidence interval.

The sample standard deviation – Since the population standard deviation is unknown, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation.

The sample size – Affects the variability of the sample mean.

The t-score corresponding to the confidence level – Since the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the t-distribution.

All these factors determine the confidence interval, so the correct choice is "All of the above."


# Question 2

> What happens to the graph of my t-distribution curve as I increase the number of degrees of freedom to infinity?

○ ✅ It approaches a normal distribution curve.

○ Its tails get increasingly fatter.

○ Its skewness shrinks to zero.

○ The confidence intervals for a given confidence level get larger.

○ The kurtosis approaches zero.

## `Explanation:`

As the number of degrees of freedom increases to infinity, the t-distribution gradually becomes indistinguishable from the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution). This is because the t-distribution has heavier tails for small degrees of freedom, but as the sample size increases, these tails shrink, and the distribution converges to a normal distribution.


# Question 3

Which of the following is the best way of interpreting a statement that, with 95% confidence, the damask rose has an average petal length of 3.3 ± 0.4 cm?

○ The true population mean has a 95% chance of being between 3.0 and 3.6 cm.

○ 95% of all damask roses have petal lengths between 2.9 and 3.7 cm.

○ ✅ If we calculated many CIs for many samples, we'd expect 95% of them to contain the true population mean.

○ 95% of all petals of observed damask roses had petal lengths between 2.9 cm and 3.7 cm.

○ If a damask rose were sampled randomly, it would have a 95% chance of having at least one petal with a length between 3.3 cm and 4.1 cm.

## `Explanation:`
A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the true population mean lies within a specific interval from a single sample. Instead, it means that if we were to take many random samples and compute confidence intervals for each, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true population mean.

#### **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. "The true population mean has a 95% chance of being between 3.0 and 3.6 cm."

- `Incorrect`: because the true population mean is a fixed value, not a random variable. The confidence interval either contains it or it doesn't.

2. "95% of all damask roses have petal lengths between 2.9 and 3.7 cm."

- `Incorrect`: because confidence intervals apply to population means, not individual observations.

3. "95% of all petals of observed damask roses had petal lengths between 2.9 cm and 3.7 cm."

- `Incorrect`: because the confidence interval does not describe the distribution of individual data points, only the estimate of the mean.

4. "If a damask rose were sampled randomly, it would have a 95% chance of having at least one petal with a length between 3.3 cm and 4.1 cm."

- `Incorrect`: because confidence intervals do not make probability statements about individual samples.
